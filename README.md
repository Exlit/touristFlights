Tourist and flights manage web User interface
Tourist and flights web UI â€“ Developer: CRUD project for tourist and flight management (user can add/edit/delete Tourist with name, surname, gender, country, remarks, date of birth. And Flight with departure, arrive, seats, price), written using Spring, JDBC, MySQL, Angular JS, REST, HTML. My goal here is to make UI with two objects (tourist and flight) that have many to many relationships. So user could add many flights to the tourist, and many tourists to the flight.
